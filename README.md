Marquee is a simple Unity3D package to display a single line of text scrolling across the bottom of the game display. It is a useful technique for displaying hints, news or distractions without pausing the game. You can supply it with lists of items in one or more text files. RTF is supported as well as a simple technique to separate quotes from attributions.
